# Pokedex-GraphQL

This application was created with the intent to learn more about GraphQL and have a different user experience compared to a classic Android App. The idea is for the user-experience to be similar to the Pokedex from the Pokemon Anime.

## Features
* Jetpack Compose
* GraphQL API ([Pokemon API](https://graphql-pokemon2.vercel.app/))
* MVVM
* Text-to-speech
* Custom Animations
